<h1> Revisiting Lab Report 3 </h1>
                                 
<p>Lab report 3 was fascinating to me because it gave me better insight into the way the grep command
worked. It is arguably one that I have used time-and-time again during this course. For this lab report,
I want to explore four different command line options for the <code>less</code> command.</p>


<h2><code>-N</code> Displays number on each line of the output.</h2>
<p>Here is the syntax for the command:
  <code>less -N [filename] </code>
    Filename is the name of the file we want to view, and less will display what is inside, with the 
    line numbers on the left side. <br>
  <b> *** WARNING: "-N" needs to be captialized! ***</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Example 1:</h3>
      Command run:
      <code> less -N ch1.txt </code>
      <h4>Output:</h4>
      ![image](1photo/np1.png)
      <p> This opens the ch1.txt file and shows the line number on the left of the screen.</p>
   <h3>Example 2:</h3>
      Command run:
      <code> less -N ch4.txt </code>
      <h4>Output:</h4>
      ![image](1photo/np2.png)
      <p> This is a good example of what it looks life if the line is exmpty. It still counts it as a space.
        How cool!</p>
