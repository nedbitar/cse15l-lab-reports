# Ned Bitar's Lab Report 2.
##### This lab report will be broken down into three sections:

##### - Part 1: Web Server

##### - Part 2: Debugging

##### - Part 3: Things learned from week 2 or 3.
<br>

## Part 1: WebServer
### This is a piece of software written by me, that simply<br>
takes input from the URL bar and then displays it for the user.<br>
My implementation specifically keeps track of the input, and displays <br>
it at once.
